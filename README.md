# Data Science Practices

This is a project to perform data science activities on data using Python and some helper modules of the language like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.

Refer to the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/Rakib1508/python-data-science/blob/master/requirements.txt) file to get all the necessary modules used for this project. The steps to build the project will be mentioned below as the project develops.

## Project timeline

Here I have documented each steps that I followed to build this project along with date & time when I have completed a step in the project timeline.

1. Start the project with a virtual environment. To create the virtual environment, run the given command in any command line terminal.
   `virtualenv ds`
   Activate virtual environment by running
   `ds\scripts\activate` in Windows, or `source bin/activate` in Mac.

2. Install all necessary Python modules given in the `requirements.txt` by running
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Try out the notebooks I provided here in this repository, or write them by yourself. To start a notebook on a browser, please type the command `jupyter notebook` on your command prompt or terminal. This will open a tab on your default browser with the root directory, where you can see all the existing notebooks and can create new notebooks too. Get started with your notebook in this way, and have fun!

4. There are some cells on the [`Python OS and Filesystem`](https://github.com/Rakib1508/python-data-science/blob/master/python-os-and-filesystem.ipynb) notebook which can only run on a linux server or on Mac OS. Please update the notebook cells for windows if you can find a solution and make pull requests.

5. Try to understand the codes using Numpy module from the [`Numpy documentation`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html). If you can improve any code, please add a new cell after the target cell and include the comment `# another solution` or `# better solution` as the first line of the cell, and then make pull requests.

6. Pandas module is a highly sophisticated tool for data analysis and simple visualization, and quite easy to learn. I find Pandas to be easier to master than Numpy, although its functionality is based on Numpy and it extends many more. Please refer to the numpy notebook [`Numpy exercises`](https://github.com/Rakib1508/python-data-science/blob/master/numpy-exercises.ipynb) to gain knowledge about the Numpy module.

7. Please refer to the [`Pandas documentation`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) to understand more about Pandas. If you can improve any part of the notebooks, please add new cells with a comment `# another solution` or `# better solution` or something similar and then make pull requests.

8. Matplotlib is the most widely used visualization module for Python, and Seaborn is built on top of this module enhancing many aspects along the way. I have used a combination of both modules to build several commonly used charts and graph in practice. I have also included an additional notebook as a shortcut reference for most commonly used graphs as [`common shortcuts`](https://github.com/Rakib1508/python-data-science/blob/master/common-shortcuts.ipynb).

9. Please refer to the [`Matplotlib documentation`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html) to understand more about Matplotlib. If you can improve any part of the notebooks, please add new cells with a comment `# another solution` or `# better solution` or something similar and then make pull requests.

10. Please refer to the [`Seaborn documentation`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html) to understand more about Seaborn. If you can improve any part of the notebooks, please add new cells with a comment `# another solution` or `# better solution` or something similar and then make pull requests.
